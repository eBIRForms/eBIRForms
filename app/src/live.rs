//! The bridge between `ra-jit-live` and nsh's engine thread.
//!
//! The daemon answers each edit with a patch: the functions that differ,
//! linked against this executable and written where [`Live::start`]
//! reserved room beside it. `install` polls for patches inside an engine
//! task — a point where no reactive work is half done — and on each one
//! applied, snapshots the [`keep`] signals and bumps `remount`. The
//! `dynamic` region under `remount` then rebuilds: components under it
//! never match an old element, so each is created again and its `view`
//! runs the new code. What `keep` marked holds its value through the
//! swap; nothing else is carried: a patch that changes a type the program
//! can see is answered `Restart` by the daemon, not applied.
//!
//! The app's model does not ride `keep`: [`store`] anchors the whole
//! `Store` — every signal of the filer's state — under the root owner, so a
//! remount redraws against the same data (an open return keeps its
//! values, the selected taxpayer stays selected). This file is the
//! dependency the anchor lives in: it is never re-emitted by a patch, so
//! its map is only ever the executable's one, on every platform.
